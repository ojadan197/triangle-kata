#Triangle Sorting

From the Columbus Scala User Group's repo of katas is a simple kata to determine different types of triangles.

Using TDD, write a method or function that accepts three numbers as the lengths of three line segments. Determine computationally which of the following cases are true:

The three segments

Can be joined into an equilateral triangle. (example: 3, 3, 3)
Can be joined into an isosceles triangle. (example: 5, 5, 3);
Can be joined into a right triangle. (example: 3, 4, 5);
Can only be joined into a triangle that is not one of the preceding cases. (example: 2, 3, 4)
Cannot be made into a triangle. (example: 2, 3, 5) [Warning: might look isosceles at first glance.]
The order in which the segments are supplied must not affect the result.
